# Blood Donation Tracking Website

A class project designed to track blood donations, test results, and blood usage for the Red Cross. This website allows users to input relevant data via the JotForm framework. The collected information is sent to an Airtable database, which is then synced to a Google Sheet. The Google Sheet is converted into a graph and displayed on the website for easy viewing of blood donation trends and statistics.

## Features
- **Data Input**: Users can submit blood donation details, test results, and blood usage information.
- **Data Storage**: All input data is securely stored in Airtable.
- **Visualization**: The data is uploaded to Google Sheets and visualized as graphs to track donation trends and blood usage.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**: For the front-end development.
- **JotForm**: For collecting data from users via forms.
- **Airtable**: For storing the submitted data.
- **Google Sheets**: For generating graphs based on the data.
- **Basic Web Hosting**: Simply upload the files to your `www` folder for hosting.
